# R-vis
A set of Visualizations created while I was exploring R's visualization capabilities. 

The file "Utah Unemployment.R" is the main file.  The R code references the various csv files.  

After creating the visualizations in R, I exported them to PDF and repositioned everything in Adobe Illustrator.   THe final visualization is found as "Utah Unemployment Final Visualziation.png"
